<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, we implemented add some basic functionality to a triangle mesh renderer. In this first part, we
    implemented Bezier curve and surfaces so that the renderer can sample from a surface and create a mesh; in the
    second part, we enable flip, split and upsampling for the mesh.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

<p>The idea of de Casteljau's algorithm is to keep using linear interpolation on the control points until the number
    of control points becomes 1. Our implementation is just to take each consecutive pair of points in the last
    layer and apply linear interpolation on each of the pairs. </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

<p>Higher dimensional de Casteljau's algorithm is to reduce dimensions by applying linear de Casteljau's algorithm
    dimension by dimension. In 3D case, the algorithm is to find linear Bezier curves on each row of control points,
    and then apply the linear algorithm again on the results.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section II: Sampling</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>

<p>In this part, we compute the normal vector at a vertex by taking a linear combination of each neighbor surface's
    normal vector by their area. We achieve this by traversing the surfaces using halfedges, finding the vectors of two
    sides that come from the same vertex, and taking cross product on the two vectors. This the cross product is the
    area-weighted normal vector of the surface, so we just sum the normal vectors up and normalize the result. This
    allows the shader to compute lighting on the surface. </p>

<div align="middle">
    <table width="100%" align="middle">
        <tr>
            <td align="middle">
                <img src="images/p3_normal_off.png" width="70%"/>

            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>


<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>

<p>We implement a halfedge flip by reconnecting the two halfedges's <code>next</code> pointer to a different set of
    surrounding halfedges. The <code>next</code> and <code>face</code> also need to be adjusted. To ensure connectivity,
    the <code>halfedge</code> pointer of the two vertices of the original edge also need to be re-adjusted. The best way
    to think of about this is to draw a picture and label all halfedges, and adjust the pointers accordingly.</p>

<div align="middle">
    <table width="100%" align="middle">
        <tr>
            <td align="middle">
                <img src="images/p4_flip_0.png" width="70%"/>
                <figcaption align="middle">A teapot.</figcaption>
            </td>
            <td align="middle">
                <img src="images/p4_flip_1.png" width="70%"/>
                <figcaption align="middle">The teapot after flipping an edge.</figcaption>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<p>Note that the surface seems to be concave into the surface, since the two triangles on the sides of the edge is not
    on the same surface.</p>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>

<p>We implement halfedge split by keeping arrays of outward halfedges from the new vertex, inward halfedges,
    surrounding halfedges, surfaces, edges and vertices. Since the process of connecting one of the new surfaces is
    symmetric to the other ones, we implement the reconnecting rule inside a loop. There should be 4 elements in each of
    the 6 arrays, and we can access previous element by invoking index <code>(i + 1) % 4</code> for the next set and
    <code>(i + 3) % 4</code> for the previous set. <br>

    We also reuse all of the existing edges and surfaces. We achieve this by instead of initializing the array with new
    elements, we put the original reference in the array. Since all of the connecting is done through accessing the four
    surrounding halfedges, we can freely edit the pointers in the reused halfedges, edges and surfaces.</p>

<div align="middle">
    <table width="100%" align="middle">
        <tr>
            <td align="middle">
                <img src="images/p5_split_0.png" width="80%"/>
                <figcaption align="middle">A teapot.</figcaption>
            </td>
            <td align="middle">
                <img src="images/p5_split_1.png" width="80%"/>
                <figcaption align="middle">After splitting some edges.</figcaption>
            </td>
            <td align="middle">
                <img src="images/p5_split_2.png" width="80%"/>
                <figcaption align="middle">After splitting and flipping some edges.</figcaption>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<p>One bug that I spent hours confusing is on the index shift. Originally I was using <code>(i - 1) % 4</code> to
    access the previous element. However, I originally presume that C++'s modulo always yield a positive number. However
    that is not true, and <code>-1 % 4 = -1</code>. Also, there's no array protection, so invoking an negative index on
    an array yields no errors. After a few hours, I finally notices that one of the halfedges is not refereed by any
    edges, which cannot be true due to symmetry. This helps me find the bug.</p>


<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>

<p>We implement upsampling following the guideline:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Calculate and store the new location of the vertices, and mark all vertices as old;</li>
    <li>Calculate the location of the edge midpoints, and mark all edges as old;</li>
    <li>Split all old edges. We iterate through the edges by assuming the newly added edges are all on the back of the
        list. By only advance times of the number of old edges, we are able to iterate through all original edges. We
        also store the new midpoint locations into the newly created vertices, and mark new edges as new. Note that the
        original edge that was split into two are both considered as old edges. The mark on the edges is to determine
        which edge to flip in the next step;
    </li>
    <li>Flip all <b>new</b> edge connecting an old and a new vertex;</li>
    <li>Assign the new location of all vertices.</li>
</ol>

<div align="middle">
    <table width="100%" align="middle">

            <td align="middle">

<p>During the upsampling process, all hard vertices and edges are softened. We can lessen this effect by pre-splitting
    along en edge to make it sharper after the upsampling as shown below. </p>

    <table width="100%" align="middle">

<p>For <code>cube.dae</code></code>, the reason that it does not subdivide symmetrically is that its original triangle
    mesh is not symmetric. By flipping the edges on thh side, the model could become symmetric as shown below.</p>
